# Focal loss for mxnet SSD example
This is an unofficial implementation of Focal Loss (https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002).

A python layer for focal loss is added, and a couple of files are modified from the original mxnet ssd example (https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/example/ssd).
## Usage
Put focal_loss_layer.py into ssd/tools and copy other files to their respective directories (don't forget to backup files before overwriting).
